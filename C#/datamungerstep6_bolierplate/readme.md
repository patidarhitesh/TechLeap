## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 6 - Database Engine Assignment

### Problem Statement

In our previous assignment step 5, we had filtered the CSV file based on to multiple where condition and selected fields.

In this assignment step, we will try to filter the data from CSV file with much more complex queries. 
  Our query is expected to contain **aggregate functions, group by, order by, aggregate group by.**
  Finally, store the filtered data in JSON file.

For Example: 

1. Query: **select city,winner,team1,team2 from data/ipl.csv where city='Bangalore' order by winner**
   
    Expected Output in JSON file: 
        
        {
          "1": {
            "winner": "",
            "city": "Bangalore",
            "team1": "Royal Challengers Bangalore",
            "team2": "Rajasthan Royals"
          },
          "2": {
            "winner": "",
            "city": "Bangalore",
            "team1": "Delhi Daredevils",
            "team2": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"
          },..........
            ..........
        } 

2. Query: **select city,sum(win_by_runs) from data/ipl.csv group by city**

    Expected Output in JSON file: 
   
        {
          "Bangalore": 1202.0,
          "Chandigarh": 536.0,
          "Delhi": 662.0,
          "Mumbai": 1058.0,
          "Kolkata": 479.0,
          ..........
          ..........
        }

3. Query: **select city,count(*) from data/ipl.csv group by city**

    Expected Output in JSON file:
   
        {
          "Bangalore": 58,
          "Chandigarh": 42,
          "Delhi": 53,
          "Mumbai": 77,
           ...........
           ........... 
        }

4. Query: **select count(city), sum(win_by_runs), min(season),max(win_by_wickets) from data/ipl.csv**

    Expected Output in JSON file:
   
        {
          "count(city)": "570",
          "sum(win_by_runs)": "7914.0",
          "min(season)": "2008",
          "max(win_by_wickets)": "10"
        }


### Expected solution

A JSON file containing the filtered result set.

### Following are the broad tasks:

- Read the query from the user
- parse the query
- forward the object of query parameter to CsvQueryProcessor
- filter out rows basis on the conditions mentioned in the where clause
- write the result set into a JSON file

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step6** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-nht.stackroute.in/stack_dotnet_datamunger/datamungerstep6_bolierplate.git`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step6 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step6`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step6` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-nht.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step6.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
